    "text": "Preface\n“Path in the Wilderness” by Erich Taeubel, Jr.\nRunning mixed models in R is no easy task. There are dozens of packages supporting these aims, each with varying functionality, syntax, and conventions. The linear mixed model ecosystem in R consists of over 80 libraries that either construct and solve mixed model equations or helper packages the process the results from mixed model analysis. These libraries provide a patchwork of overlapping and unique functionality regarding the fundamental structure of mixed models: allowable distributions, nested and crossed random effects, heterogeneous error structures and other facets. No single library has all possible functionality enabled.\nThis patchwork of packages makes it very challenging for statisticians to conduct mixed model analysis and to teach others how to run mixed models in R. The purpose of this guide to to provide some recipes for handling common analytical scenario’s that require mixed models. As a field guide, it is intended to be succinct, and to help researchers meet their analytic goals.\nIn general, the content from this website may not be copied or reproduced without attribution.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Statistical analysis is hard. Despite the common view that science produces unambiguous truths, science and statistics involve making decisions and judgement calls that affect the outcomes and conclusions of a study. These decisions are informed by our scientific thinking and (hopefully) justified in our manuscripts so they can be interrogated by other experts. The (now defunct) website 538 published a well-researched article describing some of these difficulties, the temptation to “p-hack”, and the consequences for scientific research.\nThis does not mean we should resign ourselves to get it wrong, but try our best to approach analysis remembering that the goal is to obtain truth and/or answer a specific research question, not obtain a low p-value.\n\nThe scientific method is the most rigorous path to knowledge, but it’s also messy and tough. Science deserves respect exactly because it is difficult — not because it gets everything correct on the first try. The uncertainty inherent in science doesn’t mean that we can’t use it to make important policies or decisions. It just means that we should remain cautious and adopt a mindset that’s open to changing course if new data arises. We should make the best decisions we can with the current evidence and take care not to lose sight of its strength and degree of certainty. It’s no accident that every good paper includes the phrase “more study is needed” — there is always more to learn.\n– Christie Aschwanden/538, Science Isn’t Broken\n\nBelow are some things our office frequently says to researchers.\n\n2.0.1 Think About Your Analytical Goals\nThroughout this guide, we have tried to explicitly state the goals of each analysis. This helps informs how to approach the analysis of an experiment. It can be difficult, especially for new scientists-in-training (i.e. graduate students), to understand what it is they want to estimate. You may have been handed a data set you had no role in generating and told to “analyze this” with no additional context. Or perhaps you may have conducted a large study that has some overall goals that are lofty, yet vague. And now you must translate the vague aims into clear statistical questions.\nIt can helpful to think about the exact results you are hoping to get. What does this look like exactly? Do you want to estimate the changes in plant diversity as the result of a herbicide spraying program? Do you want to find out if a fertilizer treatment changed protein content in a crop and by how much? Do you want to know about changes in human diet due to an intervention? What are quantifiable difference that you and/or experts in your domain would find meaningful?\nConsider what the results would look like for (1) the best case scenario where your wildest research dreams come true, and (2) null results, when you find out that your treatment or invention had no effect. It’s very helpful to understand and recognize exactly what both situations look like.\nBy “consider”, we mean: imagine the final plot or table, or summary sentence you want to present, either in a peer-reviewed manuscript, or some output for stakeholders. From this, you can work backwards to determine the analytical approach needed to arrive at that desired final output. Or you may determine that your data are unsuitable to generate the desired output, in which case, it’s best to ascertain that as soon as possible.\nBy “consider”, we also mean: imagine exactly what the spreadsheet of results would contain after a successful trial. What columns are present and what data are in those cells? If you are planning an experiment, this can help ensure you plan it properly to actually test whatever it is you want to evaluate. If the experiment is done, this enables you to evaluate if you have the information present to test your hypothesis.\nBy taking the time to reflect on what it is you exactly want to analyze, this can save time and prevent you from doing unneeded analyzes that don’t serve this final goal. There is rarely (never?) one way to analyze an experiment or a data set, so use your limited time wisely and focus on what matters to you most.\n\n\n2.0.2 Know That Data Cleaning is Time Consuming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: How you will spend your time\n\n\n\n\nThis has and will continue to occupy the majority of researcher’s time when conducting an analysis. Truly, we are sorry for this. But, please know it is not you, it is the nature of data. Plan for and prepare yourself mentally to spend time cleaning and preparing your data for analysis.1 This will likely take way longer than the actual analysis! It is needed to ensure you can actually get correct results in an analysis, and hence data cleaning is worth the time it requires.\n1 For an excellent set of basic instructions on data preparation, please see: Broman, K. W., & Woo, K. H. (2018). Data Organization in Spreadsheets. The American Statistician, 72(1), 2–10.\n\n2.0.3 Interpret ANOVA and P-values with Caution\n\nInformally, a p-value is the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical summary of the data (e.g., the sample mean difference between two compared groups) would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value.\n---American Statistical Association\n\nThe great majority of researchers are deeply interested in p-values. This is not a bad thing per se, but sometimes the focus is so strong it comes at the expense of other valuable pieces of information, like treatment estimates! Russ Leanth, author of the emmeans package refers to this particular practice as “star gazing”.\nIt is important to evaluate why you want to do ANOVA, what extra information it will bring and what you plan to do with those results. Sometimes, researchers want to conduct an ANOVA even though the original goals of analysis were reached without it. Running an ANOVA may increase or decrease confidence in your other results. That is not at all what ANOVA is intended to do, nor is this what p-values can tell us. ANOVA compares across group variation to within group variation. It cannot tell us if anything is the ‘same’ (there’s a separate branch of analysis, ‘equivalence testing’, for that), and it cannot tell us specifically what is different, unless you are fortunate enough to only have 2 levels in your treatment structure. P-values provide no guarantee that something is truly different or not; it only quantifies the probability you could have observed these results by chance.\nThe American Statistics Association recommends that “Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.”2 That article also explains what p-values are telling us and how to avoid committing analytical errors and/or misinterpreting p-values. If you have time to read the full article, it will benefit your research!\n2 Wasserstein, R. L., & Lazar, N. A. (2016). The ASA Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose. The American Statistician, 70(2), 129–133.The main problematic behavior I see is researchers using p-values as the sole criteria on whether to present results: “We wanted to test if x, y and z had an effect. We ran some model and found that that only x had a significant effect, and those results indicate…” (while results with a p-value &gt; 0.05 are ignored).\nA better option would be to discuss the the results of the analysis and how they addressed the research questions: how did the dependent variable change (or not change) as a result of the treatments/interventions/independent variables? What are the parameters or treatment predictions and what do they tell us with regard to the research goals? And to bolster those estimates, what are the confidence intervals on those estimates? What are the p-values for the statistical tests? P-values can support the results and conclusions, but the main results desired by a researcher are usually the estimates themselves - so lead with that!\nTo learn more about common pitfalls in interpreting p-values, check out our blog post on the subject and/or this paper3 on the subject.\n3 Greenland S, Senn SJ, Rothman KJ, Carlin JB, Poole C, Goodman SN, Altman DG. (2016) Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations. Eur J Epidemiol. 31(4):337-50.\n\n2.0.4 Comments on Hypothesis Testing and Usage of Treatment Letters\nOften, I see researchers use compact letter display (e.g. “A”, “B”, “C”, ….) for indicating differences among treatments. This makes for concise presentation of results in tables and figures, but it can both kill statistical power and misses nuance in the results.\n\n\n\nImage from a paper published in 2024. Although this was a fully crossed factorial experiment, compact letter display was implemented across all treatment combinations, resulting in some nonsensical comparisons among some more informative contrasts. What a waste.\nImplementing compact letter display can kill statistical power (the probability of detecting true differences) because it requires that all pairwise comparison being made. Doing this, especially when there are many treatment levels, has its perils. The biggest problem is that this creates a multiple testing problem. The RCBD example in this guide has 42 treatments, resulting in a total of 861 comparisons (\\(=42*(42-1)/2\\)), that are then adjusted for multiple tests. With that many tests, a severe adjustment is likely and hence things that are different are not detected. With so many tests, it could be that there is an overall effect due to treatment, but they all share the same letter!\nThe second problem is one of interpretation. Just because two treatments or varieties share a letter does not mean they are equivalent. It only means that they were not found to be different. A funny distinction, but alas. There is an entire branch of statistics, ‘equivalence testing’ devoted to just this topic - how to test if two things are actually the same. This involves the user declaring a maximum allowable numeric difference for a variable in order to determine if two items are statistically different or equivalent - something that these pairwise comparisons are not doing.]\nAnother problem is that doing all pairwise comparison may not align with experimental goals. In many circumstances, not every pairwise combination is of any interest or relevance to the study. Additionally, complex treatment structure may necessitate custom contrasts that highlight differences between the marginal estimate of multiple treatments versus another. For example, there may be 2 levels of ‘high’ nitrogen fertilizer treatment with two different sources (i.e. types of fertilizer). A researcher may want to contrast those two levels together against ‘low’ nitrogen treatment levels.\nOften, researchers have embedded additional structure in the treatments that is not fully reflected in the statistical model. For example, perhaps a study is looking at five different intercropping mixtures, two that incorporate a legume and 3 that do not. Conducting all pairwise comparisons with miss estimating the difference due to including a legume in an intercropping mix and not incorporating one. Soil fertility and other agronomic studies often have complex treatment structure. When it is not practical or financially feasible to have a full factorial experiment, embedding different treatment combinations in the main factor of analysis can accomplish this. This is a good study design approach, but compact letter display is an efficient way to report results. In such cases, custom contrasts are a better choice for hypothesis testing.The emmeans chapter covers how to do this.\n\n\n2.0.5 Final Thoughts\nGood statistical analysis requires a thoughtful, intentional approach. If you have gone to the trouble to conduct a well designed experiment or assemble a useful data set, take the time and effort to analyze it properly.\n\n\n\n\nBroman, Karl W., and Kara H.

    "text": "3.1 Mixed model terms\nMixed-effects models are called “mixed” because they simultaneously model fixed and random effects. These are also called “multilevel or”hierarchical” models in reference to groups or clusters with a hierarchical structure where we expect the groups to have correlations between their groups members.\nThis tutorial concerns (general) linear mixed models (sometimes abbreviated as “LMM”) where the dependent variable, when conditioned on the independent variable(s), follows a normal distribution. These are a special case of generalized linear mixed models (sometimes abbreviated “GLMM”), which allow the dependent variable to follow non-normal distributions. We will only be discussing the former in this tutorial.\nFixed effects represent population-level average effects that should persist across experiments. We often view our treatments or experimental interventions as fixed effects. Fixed effects are parameters drawn the entire population and/or associated with particular levels of a treatment (e.g. levels of nitrogen fertilizer). Fixed effects are similar to the parameters found in “traditional” regression techniques like ordinary least squares.\nRandom effects are discrete units sampled from some population (e.g. plots, participants), and thus they are inherently categorical. Random effects are associated with experimental units drawn at random from a population with a probability distribution. Random effects are especially useful when we have (1) many levels (e.g., many species or blocks), (2) relatively little data on each level (although we need multiple samples from most of the levels), and/or (3) uneven sampling across levels. The general thinking is that random effects represent a small sample of a population you want to make inference on.",

The value for \\(\\beta_0\\) is the overall average for \\(Y_i\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the change in \\(Y\\) as \\(X\\) changes. The slope for \\(\\beta_1\\) could represent the effects of increasing quantities of nitrogen fertilizer on crop growth.\nThe errors, 1 \\(\\epsilon_i\\), or residual are independently and identically distributed (sometimes called “iid”) following a normal distribution for general linear mixed models. Later on we will explore relaxing these assumptions.\n1 For the rest of this tutorial we will be using the term “residual” and not error term to reflect current practices. The residual is calculated as \\(Y - XB\\), it is the gap between the observed value for \\(Y_i\\) and the predicted value, \\(\\hat{Y_i}\\)\\[e_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma I_n)\\] This is an important model assumption we will revisit frequently in this tutorial.\nThere is also an expected distribution for \\(Y_i\\), but we will not be looking at this again.\n\\[ Y_i|x_i \\sim𝑁(X\\beta, \\sigma^2) \\]\nThe slope and intercept are chosen in a way so that the residual sum of squares is minimized. If we consider this model in a mixed model framework, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) would be fixed effects (also known as the population-averaged values).\nExtending this example to a mixed model, we can consider adding another term, \\(r_{ij}\\) that reflects levels sampled from a population that represent a random subset of a larger population:\n\\[  Y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + r_j + \\epsilon_{ij} \\] In an agronomic field trial, \\(r_{ij}\\) could be a random effect for block (i.e. the spatial positioning of a group of treatments). The random effect can be thought of as each block’s deviation from the fixed intercept parameter (that is, \\(\\beta_0\\)). Like the residuals term, \\(r_i\\) is independently and identically distributed (sometimes referred to as “iid”):\n\\[r_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b)\\] While random effects do not have to be normally distributed, that is the most common and most easily estimated. These are considered “random intercepts” where they all share a common \\(B_0\\) and \\(B_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample mixed model with random intercepts but identical slopes\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Random slopes models\nOther alternatives to the random intercept model include modelling random slopes where the slope between X and Y changes according to the random effect:\n\\[  Y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + r_j)X_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nIn this model, the \\(\\beta\\) is the overage effect of X on Y, and \\(r_i\\) is a random effect for block \\(j\\), and all observations share a common intercept, \\(\\beta_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed model with random slopes but identical intercepts.\n\n\nThe other alternative is including both a random slope and a random intercept:\n\\[  Y_{ij} = (\\beta_0 + r1_j) + (\\beta_1 + r2_j)X_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nIn this model, \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are random effects for subject \\(i\\) applied to the intercept and slope, respectively. Predictions would vary depending on each subject’s slope and intercept terms:\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed Model with random intercept and slope\n\n\nAnecdotally, these models appear to be uncommon in agronomic trials.",

Here are the steps to verify our data:\n\nCheck structure of the data\n\nIn this step, we need to make sure that class of variables in data is as expected e.g. replication/block are generally in the numeric format. But, for analysis the blocks/replications needs to be in a ‘character’ or ‘factor’ format. The response variable must be in a ‘numeric’ format. Sometimes the class of response variable appears to be a character, it’s important to check that and convert it to numeric format to avoid errors in model fitting.\nWe can use the base code str() in R to look at the class of each variable in the data set.\n\nstr(data)\n\nThis code will create an output showing the data class of each variable present in the data.\nThe code chunk below can be used to change the class of variable from numeric to character/factor or vice-versa. Here the example code below shows the conversion of rep from numeric to factor class and conversion of yield from character to numeric class.\n\ndata$rep &lt;- as.factor(data$rep)\ndata$yield &lt;- as.numeric(data$yield)\n\n\n\nOften, factor and character data class are used interchangeable. But we need to keep in mind the difference in these two classes. A character variable represents data stored in a text format. A factor variable is categorical variable type with values stored as levels. =factor v character\nLikewise, there is a difference in ‘integer’ and ‘numeric’ data class. A ‘integer’ class stores data as a whole number. A ‘numeric’ class stores decimal values as well (this is a default data class for numbers in R).\n\nInspect the independent variables\n\nRunning a cross tabulations across treatments and replications is generally enough to make sure the expected levels are present in the data.\n\ntable(data$trt, data$rep)\n\nThe output from this code will give us the number of observations in each replication for a given treatment. It’s supposed to have equal number of observations across treatments. Unbalanced independent variables can affect the fitting, interpretation and performance of mixed model which can result in biased estimates for fixed effects.\n\nCheck the extent of missing data\n\nIt’s important to check the extent of missing values in the data.\n\ncolSums(is.na(data))\n\nThis will give you a number of missing values in each variable. It’s an easy identification to\nThis is not needed for the data sets in this tutorial that have already been comprehensively examined, but it is helpful to check that the extent of missing values displayed in an R session is what you expect.\nHaving extreme values in the data can lead to biased estimates, model convergence issues, and incorrect variance estimates. Properly handling missing data through imputation ensures more reliable results.\nIf there were independent variables with a continuous distribution (a covariate), plot those data.\n\nInspect the dependent variable\n\nLast, check the dependent variable to ensure its distribution is following expectations. A histogram is often quite sufficient to accomplish this. This is designed to be a quick check, so no need to spend time making the plot look good.\nThe code below does not test for the normality of the response variable. Here we are creating a histogram to look at count of a given values of the response variable.\nThe target of this step is to verify the distribution of the variable and to make sure there are no anomalies in the data such as zero-inflation, right or left skewness, or any extreme high/low observations.\n\nhist(data$response)\n\nData are not expected to be normally distributed at this point, so don’t bother running any Shapiro-Wilk tests. This histogram is a check to ensure that the data are entered correctly and they appear valid. It requires a mixture of domain knowledge and statistical training to know this, but over time, if you look at these plots with regularity, you will gain a feel for what your data should look like at this stage.\nThese are not complicated checks. They are designed to be done quickly and should be done for every analysis if you have not previously inspected your data as thus. We do this before every analysis and often discover surprising things! Best to discover these things early, since they are likely to impact the final analysis.\nOnce our data passes through these pre-checks we can move to next step is building the model. the structure of data variables,",

    "text": "4.3 Model building - Formula syntax and expectations\nIn this guide we used lme4 and nlme packages fit linear mixed model.\nThe general framework for lmer() and lme() models include specifying the response variable, fixed factors, and random factors. For this demonstration, let’s assume response variable = yield, fixed factor = treatment, random factor = block.\nThe code below shows the R syntax mixed model with one fixed and one random effect:\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nmodel_lmer &lt;- lmer(response ~ fixed + (1|random),\n                   data = data1, \n                   na.action = na.exclude)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_lme &lt;- lme(response ~ fixed,\n                  random = ~ 1|random,\n                  data = data1, \n                  na.action = na.exclude)\n\n\n\n\nThe parentheses are used to indicate a random effect, and this particular notation (1|block) indicates that a ‘random intercept’ model is being fit (Please refer to Chapter 3). This is the most common approach. It means there is one overall effect fit for each block. Here, note that random effects are specified differently in the lmer() and nlme() models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nna.action = na.exclude\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed the final argument for na.action in the model statement:\nmodel_lmer &lt;- lmer(response ~ fixed + (1|random),\n                   data = data1, \n                   na.action = na.exclude)\nThe argument na.action = na.exclude provides instructions for how to handle missing data. na.exclude removes the missing data points before proceeding with the analysis. When any obervation-levels model outputs is generated (e.g. predictions, residuals), they are padded in the appropriate place to account for missing data. This is handy because it makes it easier to add those results to the original data set if so desired.\nEven when there are no missing data and this step is not necessary, it’s a good habit to be in.\n\n\nWe use the argument na.action = na.exclude as instruction for how to handle missing data: conduct the analysis, adjusting as needed for the missing data, and when prediction or residuals are output, please pad them in the appropriate places for missing data so they can be easily merged into the main data set if need be.",

    "text": "4.4 Model Assumptions\nLinear mixed models rely on linearity, independence, normality, homoscedasticity of residuals. Violating these assumptions can lead to biased estimates, inefficient inference, and convergence issues. Always diagnose model assumptions using residual plots, tests, and alternative specifications in R.\nIn this guide, we well be testing these assumptions by using graphical methods. This can be done in two ways:\n\n4.4.1 Original method\nWe can use base plot() function in R for lme4 and nlme objects to check the homoscedasticity (residuals vs. fitted values plot) of residuals.\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nplot(model_lmer, resid(., scaled=TRUE) ~ fitted(.), \n     xlab = \"fitted values\", ylab = \"studentized residuals\")\n\n\n\n\nplot(model_lme, resid(., scaled=TRUE) ~ fitted(.), \n     xlab = \"fitted values\", ylab = \"studentized residuals\")\n\n\n\n\nIn this output, we expect to see a plot with random and uniform distribution of points. If we notice any specific pattern in the distribution of points, we need to look into the model structure and response variable distribution closely.\nTo check the normality of the residuals, we need to extract the residuals first using the resid() function and then generate a qq-plot and line:\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nqqnorm(resid(model_lmer), main = NULL); qqline(resid(model_lmer))\n\n\n\n\nqqnorm(resid(model_lme), main = NULL); qqline(resid(model_lme))\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation of the qq-plots generated from this code chunk is : if residuals falls closely along the 45-degree qq-line, it suggests normality of the residuals. However, if there is strong deviation of residual points from the qq-line, consider model adjustments or data transformation.\n\n\n4.4.2 New Method\nNowadays, we can take advantage of the performance package package, which provides a comprehensive suite of diagnostic plots.\nThe diagnostic plots we created above can be created using one function check_model() from the performance package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease look for check_model() in help tab to find what other checks you can perform using this function. If you would like to check all assumptions you can use the argument check = \"all\".\n\n\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\ncheck_model(model_lmer, check = c('normality', 'linearity'))\n\n\n\n\ncheck_model(model_lme, check = c('normality', 'linearity'))",

The blocks are intended to control for a nuisance source of variation, such as over time, spatial variance, changes in equipment or operators, or myriad other causes.

R is sensitive to case and white space, which can make it easy to create near duplicate treatments, such as “eltan” and “Eltan”. There is no evidence of that in this data set.

We (the authors) know this from talking with the person who generated the data, not through our own intuition. There are no large spikes of points at a single value (indicating something odd), nor are there any extreme values (low or high) that might indicate problems.\nThis data set is ready for analysis!\n\n\n5.2.2 Model Building\n\n\nRecall the model:\n\\[y_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nFor this model, \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the variety effect (fixed) and \\(\\beta_j\\) is the block effect (random).\nHere is the R syntax for the RCBD statistical model:\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nmodel_rcbd_lmer &lt;- lmer(yield_bu_a ~ variety + (1|block),\n                   data = var_trial, \n                   na.action = na.exclude)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_rcbd_lme &lt;- lme(yield_bu_a ~ variety,\n                  random = ~ 1|block,\n                  data = var_trial, \n                  na.action = na.exclude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Check Model Assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR syntax for checking model assumptions is the same for lme4 and nlme.\n\n\nRemember those iid assumptions? Let’s make sure we actually met them.\n\n5.2.3.1 Original Method\nWe will start inspecting the model assumptions by for checking the homoscedasticity (constant variance) first using a plot() function in base R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Plot of residuals versus fitted values\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(model_rcbd_lmer, resid(., scaled=TRUE) ~ fitted(.), \n     xlab = \"fitted values\", ylab = \"studentized residuals\")\n\nWe have observed a random and uniform distribution of points. This looks good!\nAs explained in Chapter 4 we will first extract residuals usingresid() and then generate a qq-plot and line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: QQ-plot of residuals\n\n\n\n\n\nqqnorm(resid(model_rcbd_lmer), main = NULL); qqline(resid(model_rcbd_lmer))\n\nThis is reasonably good. Things do tend to fall apart at the tails a little, so this is not concerning.\n\n\n5.2.3.2 New Method\nHere, we will use the check_model() function from the performance package to look at the normality and linearity of the residuals.\n\ncheck_model(model_rcbd_lmer, check = c('normality', 'linearity'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR syntax for estimating model marginal means is the same for lme4 and nlme.\nEstimates for each treatment level can be obtained with the emmeans package.\n\nrcbd_emm &lt;- emmeans(model_rcbd_lmer, ~ variety)\nas.data.frame(rcbd_emm) %&gt;% arrange(desc(emmean))\n\n variety                  emmean       SE    df  lower.CL upper.CL\n Rosalyn                155.2703 7.212203 77.85 140.91149 169.6292\n IDO1005                153.5919 7.212203 77.85 139.23310 167.9508\n OR2080641              152.6942 7.212203 77.85 138.33536 167.0530\n Bobtail                151.6403 7.212203 77.85 137.28149 165.9992\n UI Sparrow             151.6013 7.212203 77.85 137.24245 165.9601\n Kaseberg               150.9768 7.212203 77.85 136.61794 165.3356\n IDN-01-10704A          148.9861 7.212203 77.85 134.62729 163.3450\n 06-03303B              148.8300 7.212203 77.85 134.47116 163.1888\n WB1529                 148.2445 7.212203 77.85 133.88568 162.6034\n DAS003                 145.2000 7.212203 77.85 130.84116 159.5588\n IDN-02-29001A          144.5755 7.212203 77.85 130.21665 158.9343\n Bruneau                143.9900 7.212203 77.85 129.63116 158.3488\n SY 107                 143.6387 7.212203 77.85 129.27987 157.9975\n WB 528                 142.9752 7.212203 77.85 128.61633 157.3340\n OR2080637              141.7652 7.212203 77.85 127.40633 156.1240\n Jasper                 141.2968 7.212203 77.85 126.93794 155.6556\n UI Magic CLP           139.5403 7.212203 77.85 125.18149 153.8992\n Madsen                 139.2671 7.212203 77.85 124.90826 153.6259\n LCS Biancor            139.1110 7.212203 77.85 124.75213 153.4698\n SY  Ovation            138.6426 7.212203 77.85 124.28375 153.0014\n OR2090473              137.8229 7.212203 77.85 123.46407 152.1817\n Madsen / Eltan (50/50) 136.9642 7.212203 77.85 122.60536 151.3230\n UI-WSU Huffman         135.4810 7.212203 77.85 121.12213 149.8398\n Mary                   134.8564 7.212203 77.85 120.49762 149.2153\n Norwest Tandem         134.3490 7.212203 77.85 119.99020 148.7079\n Brundage               134.0758 7.212203 77.85 119.71697 148.4346\n IDO1004                132.5145 7.212203 77.85 118.15568 146.8733\n DAS004                 132.2413 7.212203 77.85 117.88245 146.6001\n Norwest Duet           132.0852 7.212203 77.85 117.72633 146.4440\n Eltan                  131.4606 7.212203 77.85 117.10181 145.8195\n LCS Artdeco            130.8361 7.212203 77.85 116.47729 145.1950\n UI Palouse             130.4848 7.212203 77.85 116.12600 144.8437\n LOR-978                130.4458 7.212203 77.85 116.08697 144.8046\n LCS Drive              128.7674 7.212203 77.85 114.40858 143.1262\n Stephens               127.1671 7.212203 77.85 112.80826 141.5259\n OR2100940              126.1523 7.212203 77.85 111.79342 140.5111\n UI Castle CLP          125.5277 7.212203 77.85 111.16891 139.8866\n WB1376 CLP             123.6932 7.212203 77.85 109.33439 138.0521\n LOR-833                122.7565 7.212203 77.85 108.39762 137.1153\n LOR-913                118.7752 7.212203 77.85 104.41633 133.1340\n WB 456                 118.4629 7.212203 77.85 104.10407 132.8217\n SY Assure              111.0468 7.212203 77.85  96.68794 125.4056\n\nDegrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\nThis table indicates the estimated marginal means (“emmeans”, sometimes called “least squares means”), the standard error (“SE”) of those means, the degrees of freedom and the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval.

By default, sequential (type I) sums of squares is used by nlme, but partial (type 3) sums of squares is also possible. Containment is the only degrees of freedom calculation method enabled in nlme. The lmer-extender package **lmerTest* implements type 3 tests and the Kenward-Rogers method of degrees of freedom approximation by default.1\n1 The Type I method is called “sequential” sum of squares because it adds terms to the model one at a time; while type 3 (“partial”) drops model terms one at a time. This can effect the results of an F-test and p-value, but only when a data set is unbalanced across treatments, either due to design or missing data points.In this example, there is only one fixed effect, so the sums of squares choice is immaterial.\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nanova(model_rcbd_lmer, type = \"1\")\n\nType I Analysis of Variance Table with Satterthwaite's method\n        Sum Sq Mean Sq NumDF DenDF F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \nvariety  18354  447.65    41   123  2.4528 8.017e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\n\n\nanova(model_rcbd_lme, type = \"sequential\")\n\n            numDF denDF   F-value p-value\n(Intercept)     1   123 2514.1283  &lt;.0001\nvariety        41   123    2.4528   1e-04",

Each factor can have multiple levels, and combinations of these levels form the experimental conditions. This design allows us to understand the main effects of individual factors and their interactions on the response variable.

    "text": "7.1 Details for Split Plot Designs\nIn some multifactor factorial experiments, we may be unable to completely randomize the order of the treatments. This often results in a generalization of the factorial design called a split-plot design. Such design may incorporate one or more of the completely randomized (CRD), completely randomized block (RCBD). The main principle is that there are whole plots or whole units, to which the levels of one or more factors are applied. Thus each whole plot becomes a block for the subplot treatments.\nThe statistical model structure this design:\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + (\\alpha_i\\beta_j) + \\epsilon_{ij} + \\delta_{ijk} \\] Where:\n\\(\\mu\\)= overall experimental mean, \\(\\alpha\\) = main effect of whole plot (fixed), \\(\\beta\\) = main effect of subplot (fixed), \\(\\alpha\\)\\(\\beta\\) = interaction between factors A and B, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) = whole plot error, \\(\\delta_{ijk}\\) = subplot error.\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon)\\]\n\\[\\ \\delta  \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\delta)\\]\nBoth the error and replication effects are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations of \\(\\sigma_\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\delta\\), respectively.\nThis is also referred as “Split-Block RCB” design. The statistical model structure for split plot design:\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\rho_i +  \\alpha_j + \\beta_k + (\\alpha_j\\beta_k) + \\epsilon_{ij} + \\delta_{ijk}\\] Where:\n\\(\\mu\\) = overall experimental mean, \\(\\rho\\) = block effect (random), \\(\\alpha\\) = main effect of whole plot (fixed), \\(\\beta\\) = main effect of subplot (fixed), \\(\\alpha\\)\\(\\beta\\) = interaction between factors A and B, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) = whole plot error, \\(\\delta_{ijk}\\) = subplot error.\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon)\\]\n\\[\\ \\delta  \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\delta)\\]\nBoth the overall error and the rep effects are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations of \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\delta\\), respectively.",

In this data set, class of the whole-plot, sub-plot, and block should be factor/character and response variable (height) should be numeric.\n\n\nstr(height_data)\n\ntibble [192 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ time  : chr [1:192] \"T1\" \"T1\" \"T1\" \"T1\" ...\n $ manage: chr [1:192] \"M1\" \"M2\" \"M3\" \"M4\" ...\n $ rep   : chr [1:192] \"R1\" \"R1\" \"R1\" \"R1\" ...\n $ sample: chr [1:192] \"S1\" \"S1\" \"S1\" \"S1\" ...\n $ height: num [1:192] 104.5 92.3 96.8 94.7 105.7 ...\n\n\nThe ‘time’, ‘manage’, and ‘rep’ are character and variable height is numeric.

For example, in this example the random effects will be designated as (1 | rep/time). This implies that we use random intercept at each of the rep and time (whole-plot) level.\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nmodel_lmer &lt;- lmer(height ~ time*manage + (1|rep/time), data = height_data)\ntidy(model_lmer)\n\n# A tibble: 35 × 8\n   effect group term        estimate std.error statistic     df    p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  (Intercept)   108.        3.19    33.9     4.38 0.00000181\n 2 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  timeT2          3.18      2.63     1.21  104.   0.229     \n 3 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  timeT3         -2.25      2.63    -0.855 104.   0.394     \n 4 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  timeT4          1.28      2.63     0.488 104.   0.627     \n 5 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  manageM2       -4.45      2.55    -1.74  152.   0.0832    \n 6 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  manageM3       -5.30      2.55    -2.08  152.   0.0395    \n 7 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  manageM4       -6.18      2.55    -2.42  152.   0.0166    \n 8 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  manageM5       -5.02      2.55    -1.97  152.   0.0511    \n 9 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  manageM6       -3.42      2.55    -1.34  152.   0.183     \n10 fixed  &lt;NA&gt;  manageM7       -9.75      2.55    -3.82  152.   0.000193  \n# ℹ 25 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel_lme &lt;-lme(height ~ time*manage,\n             random = ~ 1|rep/time, data = height_data)\n\ntidy(model_lme)\n\nWarning in tidy.lme(model_lme): ran_pars not yet implemented for multiple\nlevels of nesting\n\n\n# A tibble: 32 × 7\n   effect term        estimate std.error    df statistic  p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 fixed  (Intercept)   108.        3.19   152    33.9   9.58e-73\n 2 fixed  timeT2          3.18      2.63     6     1.21  2.72e- 1\n 3 fixed  timeT3         -2.25      2.63     6    -0.855 4.25e- 1\n 4 fixed  timeT4          1.28      2.63     6     0.488 6.43e- 1\n 5 fixed  manageM2       -4.45      2.55   152    -1.74  8.32e- 2\n 6 fixed  manageM3       -5.30      2.55   152    -2.08  3.95e- 2\n 7 fixed  manageM4       -6.18      2.55   152    -2.42  1.66e- 2\n 8 fixed  manageM5       -5.02      2.55   152    -1.97  5.11e- 2\n 9 fixed  manageM6       -3.42      2.55   152    -1.34  1.83e- 1\n10 fixed  manageM7       -9.75      2.55   152    -3.82  1.93e- 4\n# ℹ 22 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.3 Check Model Assumptions\nBefore interpreting the model we should investigate the assumptions of the model to ensure any conclusions we draw are valid. The assumptions that we can check are: 1. Homogeneity (equal variance) 2. normality of residuals.\nWe will use check_model() function from performance package. The plots generated using this code gives a visual check of various assumptions including normality of residuals, normality of random effects, heteroscedasticity, homogeneity of variance, and multicollinearity.\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\ncheck_model(model_lmer, check = c('normality', 'linearity'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheck_model(model_lme, check = c('normality', 'linearity'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the residuals fit the assumptions of the model well.\n\n\n7.2.1.4 Inference\nThe anova() function prints the the rows of analysis of variance table for whole-plot, sub-plot, and their interactions.

Now we will demonstrate how to analyze data from the RCBD split plot experiment design. The oats data used in this example is from the MASS package. The design is RCBD split plot with 6 blocks, 3 main plots and 4 subplots.

    "text": "8.1 Details for split-split plot designs\nThe concept of split-plot design can be extended to situations in which randomization restrictions may occur at any number of levels within the experiment. If there are two levels of randomization restriction, the layout is called a split-split plot design. The split-split-plot design is an extension of the split-plot design to accommodate a third factor: one factor in main-plot, other in subplot and the third factor in sub-subplot. The example shown below illustrates this experiment layout.\nThe statistical model structure this design:\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\rho_j +  \\alpha_i + \\beta_k + (\\alpha\\beta)_{ik} + \\tau_n + (\\alpha\\tau)_{in} + (\\tau\\beta)_{nk} + (\\alpha\\beta\\tau)_{ikn} + \\epsilon_{ijk} + \\delta_{ijkn}\\] Where:\n\\(\\mu\\)= overall experimental mean, \\(\\alpha\\) = main effect of whole plot (fixed), \\(\\beta\\) = main effect of subplot (fixed), \\(\\tau\\) = main effect of sub-subplot, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) = whole plot error, \\(\\delta_{ijk}\\) = subplot error.\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon)\\]\n\\[\\ \\delta  \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\delta)\\]\nThe assumptions of the model includes normal distribution of both the error and the rep effects with a mean of zero and standard deviations of \\(\\sigma_\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\delta\\), respectively.",

The order is which nitrogen treatments are applied is randomly selected. The 3 management practices are randomly assigned to the sub-plots. Finally, within a particular management, the 3 varieties are tested in a random order, forming 3 sub-subplots.\n\n8.2.1 Data integrity checks\nBefore analyzing the data let’s do some preliminary data quality checks. We will start with evaluation of the structure of the data where class of block, nitrogen, management and variety should be a character/factor and yield should be numeric.\n\nstr(rice)\n\n'data.frame':   135 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ X         : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ block     : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ nitrogen  : int  0 0 0 50 50 50 80 80 80 110 ...\n $ management: chr  \"m1\" \"m2\" \"m3\" \"m1\" ...\n $ variety   : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ yield     : num  3.32 3.77 4.66 3.19 3.62 ...\n\n\nHere we need to convert block, nitrogen, variety, and management to characters.\n\nrice$block &lt;- as.character(rice$block)\nrice$nitrogen &lt;- as.character(rice$nitrogen)\nrice$management &lt;- as.character(rice$management)\nrice$variety &lt;- as.character(rice$variety)\n\nNext, run a cross tabulations to check balance of observations across independent variables:\n\ntable(rice$variety, rice$nitrogen, rice$management)\n\n, ,  = m1\n\n   \n    0 110 140 50 80\n  1 3   3   3  3  3\n  2 3   3   3  3  3\n  3 3   3   3  3  3\n\n, ,  = m2\n\n   \n    0 110 140 50 80\n  1 3   3   3  3  3\n  2 3   3   3  3  3\n  3 3   3   3  3  3\n\n, ,  = m3\n\n   \n    0 110 140 50 80\n  1 3   3   3  3  3\n  2 3   3   3  3  3\n  3 3   3   3  3  3\n\n\nIt looks perfectly balanced, with exactly 3 observation per treatment group.\nLast, check the distribution of the dependent variable by plotting a histogram of yield values using hist() in R.\n\nhist(rice$yield, col = \"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Histogram of the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Model Building\nThe variance analysis of a split-split plot design is divided into three parts: the main-plot, subplot and sub-subplot analysis. We can use the nesting notation in the random part because nitrogen and management are nested in blocks.

    "text": "9.1 Background\nAlso referred by ‘strip-plot design’ or ‘strip-split-plot design’. This design had an extensive application in the agricultural sciences. In the simplest case, we have two factors A and B. Factor A is applied to whole plots same as in the standard split-plot design. Then factor B is applied to strips (which are just another set of whole plots) that are orthogonal to the original whole plots used for factor A.\nThe statistical model for this design is:\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\alpha_j + (\\tau\\alpha)_{ij} + \\beta_k + (\\tau\\beta)_{ik} + (\\alpha\\beta)_{jk} +  \\epsilon_{ijk}\\] Where:\n\\(\\mu\\)= overall experimental mean, \\((\\tau\\alpha)_{ij}\\), \\((\\tau\\beta)_{ik}\\), and \\(\\epsilon_{ijk}\\) are the errors used to test factor A, B, and their interaction AB, respectively. \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the main effects applied A and B, and \\(\\alpha_j\\beta_k\\) represents the interaction between main factors.\n\\[ \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\]",

The plot below shows the application of treatments in horizontal and vertical direction in a strip plot design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.1 Data integrity checks\n\nCheck structure of the data\n\nThe ‘rep’, ‘nitro’, and ‘gen’ variables in the data needs to be a factor/character variables and ‘yield’ should be numeric.\n\nstr(data1)\n\n'data.frame':   54 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ X    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ yield: int  2373 4076 7254 4007 5630 7053 2620 4676 7666 2726 ...\n $ rep  : chr  \"R1\" \"R1\" \"R1\" \"R1\" ...\n $ nitro: int  0 60 120 0 60 120 0 60 120 0 ...\n $ gen  : chr  \"G1\" \"G1\" \"G1\" \"G2\" ...\n $ col  : int  1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 ...\n $ row  : int  1 1 1 3 3 3 4 4 4 2 ...\n\n\nLet’s convert ‘nitro’ from numeric to factor.\n\ndata1$nitro &lt;- as.factor(data1$nitro)\n\n\nInspect the independent variables\n\nLet’s running a a cross tabulation of independent variables to look at the balance of treatment factors.\n\ntable(data1$gen, data1$nitro)\n\n    \n     0 60 120\n  G1 3  3   3\n  G2 3  3   3\n  G3 3  3   3\n  G4 3  3   3\n  G5 3  3   3\n  G6 3  3   3\n\n\nIt looks balanced with 3 number of observations for each variety and nitrogen level.\n\nCheck the extent of missing data\n\nNext step is to identify if there are any missing observations in the data set.\n\ncolSums(is.na(data1))\n\n    X yield   rep nitro   gen   col   row \n    0     0     0     0     0     0     0 \n\n\nWe don’t have any missing values in this data set.\n\nInspect the dependent variable\n\nLet’s check the distribution of dependent variable by plotting a histogram.\n\nhist(data1$yield, main = \"\", xlab = \"yield\", col = \"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Histogram of the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\nNo extreme values or skewness is present in the yield values.\n\n\n9.2.2 Model Building\nThe goal of this analysis is to evaluate the impact of nitro, gen, and their interaction on rice yield. The rep, gen nested in rep, and nitro nested in rep were random effects in the model.

    "text": "10.1 Background\nThe block design described in Chapter 4 was complete, meaning that each block contained each treatment level at least once. In practice, it may not be possible or advisable to include all treatments in each block, either due to limitations in treatment availability (e.g. limited seed stocks) or the block size becomes too large to serve its original goals of controlling for spatial variation.\nIn such cases, randomized incomplete block designs (IBD) can be used. Incomplete block designs break the experiment into many smaller incomplete blocks that are nested within standard RCBD-style blocks and assigns a subset of the treatment levels to each incomplete block. There are several different approaches (Yates 1936) for how to assign treatment levels to incomplete blocks and these designs impact the final statistical analysis (and if all treatments included in the experimental design are estimable). [^icbd-1] [^icbd-2] An excellent description of incomplete block design is provided in ANOVA and Mixed Models by Lukas Meier.\nIncomplete block designs are grouped into two groups: (1) balanced lattice designs; and (2) partially balanced (also commonly called alpha-lattice) designs. Balanced IBD designs have been previously called “lattice designs” [need refs], but we are not using that term to avoid confusion with alpha-lattice designs, a term that is commonly used.\nIn alpha-lattice design, the blocks are grouped into complete replicates. These designs are also termed as “resolvable incomplete block designs” or “partially balanced incomplete block designs” (Patterson and Williams 1976). This design has been more commonly used instead of balanced IBD because of it’s practicability, flexibility, and versatility.",

    "text": "10.1.1 Statistical Model\nThe statistical model for a balanced incomplete block design is:\n\\[y_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\mu\\) = overall experimental mean\n\\(\\alpha\\) = treatment effects (fixed)\n\\(\\beta\\) = block effects (random)\n\\(\\epsilon\\) = error terms\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma)\\]\n\\[ \\beta \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b)\\]\nThere are few key points that we need to keep in mind while designing incomplete block experiments:\n\nA drawback of this design is that block effect and treatment effects are confounded.\nTo remove the block effects, it is better compare treatments within a block.\nNo treatment should appear twice in any block as it contributes nothing to within block comparisons.\n\nThe balanced incomplete block designs are guided by strict principles and guidelines including: the number of treatments must be a perfect square (e.g. 25, 36, and so on), and number of replicates must be equal to number of blocks + 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on Sums of Squares\n\n\n\nBecause the blocks are incomplete, the type I and type III sums of squares will be different even when there is no missing data from a trail. That is because the missing treatments in each block represent missing observations (even though they are not missing ‘at random’).",

The trial was laid out in an alpha lattice design. This trial data had 24 genotypes (“gen”), 6 incomplete blocks, each replicated 3 times.\nLet’s start analyzing this example first by loading the required libraries for linear mixed models:\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nlibrary(lme4); library(lmerTest); library(emmeans)\nlibrary(dplyr); library(broom.mixed); library(performance)\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(nlme); library(broom.mixed); library(emmeans)\nlibrary(dplyr); library(performance)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s import a data with partial balanced icomplete design. This data was obtained from the agridat package.\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"partial_incblock.csv\"))\n\n\nTable of variables in the data set\n\n\nblock\nincomplete blocking unit\n\n\ngen\ngenotype (variety) factor\n\n\nrow\nrow position for each plot\n\n\ncol\ncolumn position for each plot\n\n\nyield\ngrain yield in tonnes/ha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2.1 Data integrity checks\n\nCheck structure of the data\n\nLet’s look into the structure of the data first to verify the class of the variables.\n\nstr(data1)\n\n'data.frame':   72 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ X    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ plot : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ rep  : chr  \"R1\" \"R1\" \"R1\" \"R1\" ...\n $ block: chr  \"B1\" \"B1\" \"B1\" \"B1\" ...\n $ gen  : chr  \"G11\" \"G04\" \"G05\" \"G22\" ...\n $ yield: num  4.12 4.45 5.88 4.58 4.65 ...\n $ row  : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ col  : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nHere, rep, block and gen are character and yield as a integer. We can continue with this.\n\nInspect the independent variables\n\nNext step is to evaluate the independent variables. First, check the number of treatments per replication (each treatment should be replicated 3 times).\n\nagg_tbl &lt;- data1 %&gt;% group_by(gen) %&gt;% \n  summarise(total_count=n(),\n            .groups = 'drop')\nagg_tbl\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 2\n   gen   total_count\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 G01             3\n 2 G02             3\n 3 G03             3\n 4 G04             3\n 5 G05             3\n 6 G06             3\n 7 G07             3\n 8 G08             3\n 9 G09             3\n10 G10             3\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nThis looks balanced, as expected.

    "text": "11.1 Background\nIn the Latin Square design, two blocking factors are arranged across the row and the column of the square. This allows blocking of two nuisance factors across rows and columns to reduce even more experimental error. The requirement of Latin square design is that all t treatments appears only once in each row and column and number of replications is equal to number of treatments.\nAdvantages of Latin square design are:\nDisadvantages:\nStatistical model for a response in Latin square design is:\n\\(Y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j +  \\gamma_k + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\)\nwhere, \\(\\mu\\) is the experiment mean, \\(\\alpha_i\\) represents treatment effect, \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are the row- and column specific effects.\nAssumptions of this design includes normality and independent distribution of error (\\(\\epsilon_{ijk}\\)) terms. And there is no interaction between two blocking (rows & columns) factors and treatments.",

In this experiment, 5 treatments (A = Dusted before rains. B = Dusted after rains. C = Dusted once each week. D = Drifting, once each week. E = Not dusted) were tested to control stem rust in wheat.\n\ndat &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"latin_square.csv\"))\n\n\nTable of variables in the data set\n\n\ntrt\ntreatment factor, 5 levels\n\n\nrow\nrow position for each plot\n\n\ncol\ncolumn position for each plot\n\n\nyield\nwheat yield\n\n\n\n\n11.2.1 Data integrity checks\n\nCheck structure of the data\n\nFirst, let’s verify the class of variables in the dataset using str() function in base R\n\nstr(dat)\n\n'data.frame':   25 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ X    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ trt  : chr  \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" ...\n $ yield: num  4.9 9.3 7.6 5.3 9.3 6.4 4 15.4 7.6 6.3 ...\n $ row  : int  5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 ...\n $ col  : int  1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n\n\nHere yield and trt are classified as numeric and factor variables, respectively, as needed. But we need to change ‘row’ and ‘col’ from integer to factor/character.\n\ndat1 &lt;- dat |&gt; \n        mutate(row = as.factor(row),\n               col = as.factor(col))\n\n\nInspect the independent variables\n\nNext, to verify if the data meets the assumption of the Latin square design let’s plot the field layout for this experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks great! Here we can see that there are equal number (5) of treatments, rows, and columns. Treatments were randomized in such a way that one treatment doesn’t appear more than once in each row and column.\n\nCheck the extent of missing data\n\nNext step is to check if there are any missing values in response variable.\n\ncolSums(is.na(dat))\n\n    X   trt yield   row   col \n    0     0     0     0     0 \n\n\nNo missing values detected in this data set.\n\nInspect the dependent variable\n\nBefore fitting the model, let’s create a histogram of response variable to see if there are extreme values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\nhist(dat1$yield, main = \"\", xlab = \"yield\", col = \"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Model fitting\nHere we will fit a model to evaluate the impact of fungicide treatments on wheat yield with trt as a fixed effect and row & col as a random effect.\n\nlme4nlme\n\n\n\nm1_a &lt;- lmer(yield ~ trt + (1|row) + (1|col),\n           data = dat1,\n           na.action = na.exclude)\nsummary(m1_a) \n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML. t-tests use Satterthwaite's method [\nlmerModLmerTest]\nFormula: yield ~ trt + (1 | row) + (1 | col)\n   Data: dat1\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 89.8\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.3994 -0.5383 -0.1928  0.5220  1.8429 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n row      (Intercept) 1.8660   1.3660  \n col      (Intercept) 0.2336   0.4833  \n Residual             2.3370   1.5287  \nNumber of obs: 25, groups:  row, 5; col, 5\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "13 Example Analysis\nIn the previous chapters we have covered how to run linear mixed models for different experiment designs. All of the examples in those chapters were independent measure designs, where each subject was assigned to a different treatment. Now we will move on to experiment with repeated measures effects (also called “longtudinal data”).\nStudies that involve repeated observations of the exact same experimental units (or subjects) requires a repeated measures component in analysis to properly model correlations across time for each subject. This is common in studies that are evaluated across different time periods. For example, if samples are collected over the different time periods from same subject, we have to model the repeated measures effect while analyzing the main effects.\nIn these models, the ‘iid’ assumption (independently and identically distributed) is being violated often, so we need to introduce specialized covariance structures that can account for these correlations between error terms.\nFitting models with correlated observations requires new libraries including mmrm and nlme. The lme4 package allows random effects only. In this chapter, we will analyze the data with repeated measures from different experiment designs including randomized complete block design, split plot, and split-split plot design.\nThere are several types of covariance structures:\nThe repeated measures syntax in nlme follow this convention:\ncorr = corAR1(value = 0, form = ~ t|g, fixed = FALSE).\nThe argument for ‘value’ is the starting value for iterations (zero, unless you specify something else), and if fixed = FALSE (the current nlme default), this value will be allowed to change during the model fitting process. The argument structure for form, ~ t or ~ t|g, specifying a time covariate \\(t\\) and, optionally a grouping factor g (if a group factor is not specified, the observation order will be used). When we use ~t|g form, the correlation structure is assumed to apply only to observations within the same grouping level. The covariate for this correlation structure must be a integer value. corCompSymm() and corSymm() follow the same argument syntax.\nThere are other covariance structures (e.g. corARMA(), corCAR1()), but we have found that corAR1() and corCompSymm() work for most circumstances. Type ?cor in an R console for more options and details on the syntax\nFor examples used in this chapter we will fitting model using mmrm and lme packages. So, let’s start with loading the required libraries for this analysis.\nFirst, we will start with the first example from a randomized complete block design with repeated measures.",

To account for the variation caused by repeated measurements, we can model the correlation among responses for a given subject which is plot (factor variable) in this case.\nBy adding this correlation structure, we are accounting for variation caused by repeated measurements over weeks for each plot. The AR1 structure assumes that data points collected more proximate are more correlated. Whereas, the compound symmetry structure assumes that correlation is equal for all time gaps. Here, we will fit model with both correlation structures and compare models to find out the best fit model.\nIn this analysis, time variable is week and it must be numeric.\n\ncs1 &lt;- corAR1(form = ~ week|block/factplot,  value = 0.2, fixed = FALSE)\ncs2 &lt;- corCompSymm(form = ~ week|block/factplot,  value = 0.2, fixed = FALSE)\n\nIn the code chunk above, we fitted two correlation structures including AR1 and compound symmetry matrices.

Previously, we used lme() from nlme package to fit the model. In this example, along with nlme() we will also mmrm() function from the mmrm package. In addition, instead of summary() function we will use tidy() function from the broom.mixed package to look at estimates of mixed and random effects. This will generate a tidy workflow in particular by providing standardized verbs that provide information on estimates, standard errors, confidence intervals, etc.\n\nnlmemmrm\n\n\n\ncorr_str1 = corAR1(form = ~ Sample_time|Rep/Variety/plot, value = 0.2, fixed = FALSE)\n\nfit1 &lt;- lme(Yield ~ Sample_time1*Variety*Fertilizer,\n                random = ~ 1|Rep/Variety/plot,\n                corr= corr_str1,\n                data = Yield, na.action= na.exclude)\ntidy(fit1)\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 7\n   effect term                      estimate std.error    df statistic   p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 fixed  (Intercept)                  1.86      0.708    72     2.63  0.0105   \n 2 fixed  Sample_time12                0.515     0.688    72     0.748 0.457    \n 3 fixed  Sample_time13                0.787     0.674    72     1.17  0.247    \n 4 fixed  Sample_time14                1.35      0.675    72     2.00  0.0496   \n 5 fixed  Sample_time15                2.84      0.675    72     4.21  0.0000731\n 6 fixed  VarietyVAR2                 -0.996     0.861     3    -1.16  0.331    \n 7 fixed  Fertilizer2                  1.27      0.861    12     1.47  0.167    \n 8 fixed  Fertilizer3                  2.07      0.861    12     2.40  0.0333   \n 9 fixed  Sample_time12:VarietyVAR2    0.739     0.974    72     0.759 0.451    \n10 fixed  Sample_time13:VarietyVAR2    0.269     0.954    72     0.282 0.779    \n# ℹ 20 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nfit2 &lt;- mmrm(formula = Yield ~ Sample_time1*Variety*Fertilizer +  \n             ar1(Sample_time1|Rep/plot),\n             data = Yield)\n\ntidy(fit2)\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 6\n   term                      estimate std.error    df statistic   p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)                  2.86      0.464 12.7      6.16  0.0000387\n 2 Sample_time12                0.656     0.310  1.81     2.12  0.182    \n 3 Sample_time13                1.40      0.414  2.29     3.39  0.0636   \n 4 Sample_time14                1.46      0.484  2.87     3.01  0.0605   \n 5 Sample_time15                2.47      0.549  3.14     4.50  0.0186   \n 6 VarietyVAR2                 -1.07      0.656 12.7     -1.63  0.128    \n 7 Fertilizer2                  1.67      0.656 12.7      2.55  0.0245   \n 8 Fertilizer3                  0.595     0.656 12.7      0.908 0.381    \n 9 Sample_time12:VarietyVAR2   -0.591     0.438  1.81    -1.35  0.321    \n10 Sample_time13:VarietyVAR2   -0.412     0.586  2.29    -0.704 0.546    \n# ℹ 20 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Model diagnostics\nWe will use check_model() from performance package to evaluate the model fitness of model fitted using nlme (mod1).

Given this odd distribution, it may be tempting to consider a transformation in order to attempt to impose normality. It’s important to remember that the assumption of normality applies to the residuals, not the raw data. Plotting the data is for checking the data looks as expected, a judgement that requires some knowlede of the experiment (this was Julia Piaskowski’s PhD research). In this case, the time points, PT1 and PT2, reflect early wheat growth stages (tillering and jointing, respectively), and the final time point is senescent leaf tissue at grain maturity. At that physiological stage, it is normal for phosphorus leaf concentration to be much lower. Since the data look as expected, we will proceed with a general linear model and evaluate the residuals from the model fitting process when deciding if a non-normal distribution is appropriate for the data.\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Model fit\n\ncorr_str1 = corCompSymm(form = ~ time1|rep/Ptrt/Inoc/plot, value = 0.2, fixed = FALSE)\n\nfit1 &lt;- lme(P_leaf ~ time*Ptrt*Inoc*Cv,\n                random = ~ 1|rep/Ptrt/Inoc/plot,\n                corr = corr_str1,\n                data = phos1, na.action= na.exclude)\n\n\ncheck_model(fit1, check = c('qq', 'linearity'), detrend=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model fit a first glance is not ideal, but that LOESS line is trying to model a space where there are no data (between 500 and 1500 ppm P leaf concentration), so that can introduce artifacts.

    "text": "13.1 Background\nTo start off with, we need to define estimated marginal means. Estimated marginal means are defined as marginal means of a variable across all levels of other variables in a model, essentially giving a “population-level” average.\nThe emmeans package is one of the most commonly used package in R in determine marginal means. This package provides methods for obtaining marginal means (also known as least-squares means) for factor combinations in a variety of models. The emmeans package is one of several alternatives to facilitate post hoc methods application and contrast analysis. It is a relatively recent replacement for the lsmeans package that some R users may be familiar with. It is intended for use with a wide variety of ANOVA models, including repeated measures and nested designs (mixed models). This is a flexible package that comes with a set of detailed vignettes and works with a lot of different model objects.\nIn this chapter, we will demonstrate the extended use of the emmeans package to calculate estimated marginal means and contrasts.\nTo demonstrate the use of the emmeans package. We will pull the model from split plot lesson (Chapter 6), where we evaluated the effect of Nitrogen and Variety on Oat yield. This data contains 6 blocks, 3 main plots (Variety) and 4 subplots (Nitrogen). The primary outcome variable was oat yield. To read more about the experiment layout details please read RCBD split-plot section in Chapter 6.",

This can be evaluated as shown below:\n\ncontrast(m2, method = list(A1 - A2) )\n\n contrast       estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n c(1, -1, 0, 0)    -19.5 4.44 45  -4.396  0.0001\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: V \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \n\ncontrast(m2, method = list(A1 - A3) )\n\n contrast       estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n c(1, 0, -1, 0)    -34.8 4.44 45  -7.853  &lt;.0001\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: V \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \n\ncontrast(m2, method = list(A1 - A4) )\n\n contrast       estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n c(1, 0, 0, -1)      -44 4.44 45  -9.919  &lt;.0001\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: V \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \n\n\nHere the output shows the difference in mean yield between control and 3 N treatments. The results shows that yield was significantly higher N treatments compared to the control (0.0cwt) irrespective of the oat variety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast() vs pairs()\n\n\n\nUsing custom contrast() is strongly recommended instead of pairs() when you are comparing multiple treatment groups (&gt;5).\n\n\nIn addition to these conventional custom contrast options, emmeans package allows to do some easy contrasts such as comparing all the treatments to control or estimating custom contrast to compare one treatment level to all other groups.\nWe will start with running ‘m1’ emmeans object\n\nm1\n\n V           emmean  SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n Golden.rain  104.5 7.8  5     84.5      125\n Marvellous   109.8 7.8  5     89.7      130\n Victory       97.6 7.8  5     77.6      118\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\nBased on m1 object, let’s assume we want to compare all varieties with Marvellous. The code shown below estimates custom contrast for treatments vs control and here we are referring Marvellous variety as a control.\n\ncontrast(m1, \"trt.vs.ctrl\", ref = \"Marvellous\")\n\n contrast                 estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Golden.rain - Marvellous    -5.29 7.08 10  -0.748  0.6833\n Victory - Marvellous       -12.17 7.08 10  -1.719  0.2045\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests \n\n\nOr we can refer control group by the appearance order of varieties in m1. In m1, order of Golden rain, Marvellous, and Victory are ordered as 1, 2, and 3 respenctively.\nLet’s suppose we want to compare Golden rain to other varieties, we can do this by either trt.vs.ctrl1' code, ortrt.vs.ctrlk` and referring to group 1. Both code options will generate same results.\n\ncontrast(m1, \"trt.vs.ctrl1\")\n\n contrast                 estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Marvellous - Golden.rain     5.29 7.08 10   0.748  0.6833\n Victory - Golden.rain       -6.88 7.08 10  -0.971  0.5476\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests \n\ncontrast(m1, \"trt.vs.ctrlk\", ref = 1)\n\n contrast                 estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Marvellous - Golden.rain     5.29 7.08 10   0.748  0.6833\n Victory - Golden.rain       -6.88 7.08 10  -0.971  0.5476\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests \n\n\nWe can further customize the contrasts by excluding specific treatment groups from the comparison.\n\nm1\n\n V           emmean  SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n Golden.rain  104.5 7.8  5     84.5      125\n Marvellous   109.8 7.8  5     89.7      130\n Victory       97.6 7.8  5     77.6      118\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\nm2\n\n N      emmean   SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n 0.0cwt   79.4 7.17  5     60.9     97.8\n 0.2cwt   98.9 7.17  5     80.4    117.3\n 0.4cwt  114.2 7.17  5     95.8    132.7\n 0.6cwt  123.4 7.17  5    104.9    141.8\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: V \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\ncontrast(m1, \"trt.vs.ctrl\", ref = \"Marvellous\")\n\n contrast                 estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Golden.rain - Marvellous    -5.29 7.08 10  -0.748  0.6833\n Victory - Marvellous       -12.17 7.08 10  -1.719  0.2045\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests \n\ncontrast(m1, \"trt.vs.ctrlk\", ref = 3)\n\n contrast              estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Golden.rain - Victory     6.88 7.08 10   0.971  0.5476\n Marvellous - Victory     12.17 7.08 10   1.719  0.2045\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: dunnettx method for 2 tests \n\ncontrast(m1, \"pairwise\")\n\n contrast                 estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Golden.rain - Marvellous    -5.29 7.08 10  -0.748  0.7419\n Golden.rain - Victory        6.88 7.08 10   0.971  0.6104\n Marvellous - Victory        12.17 7.08 10   1.719  0.2458\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: N \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates \n\npairs(m2, exclude = 2)\n\n contrast        estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n 0.0cwt - 0.4cwt   -34.83 4.44 45  -7.853  &lt;.0001\n 0.0cwt - 0.6cwt   -44.00 4.44 45  -9.919  &lt;.0001\n 0.4cwt - 0.6cwt    -9.17 4.44 45  -2.067  0.1084\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: V \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates \n\ncontrast(m2, \"consec\")\n\n contrast        estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n 0.2cwt - 0.0cwt    19.50 4.44 45   4.396  0.0002\n 0.4cwt - 0.2cwt    15.33 4.44 45   3.457  0.0032\n 0.6cwt - 0.4cwt     9.17 4.44 45   2.067  0.1152\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: V \nDegrees-of-freedom method: containment \nP value adjustment: mvt method for 3 tests",

    "text": "13.4 Compact letter displays\nCompact letter displays (CLDs) are a popular way to display multiple comparisons when there are more than few group means to compare. However, they are problematic as they are more prone to misinterpretation. The R package multcompView (Graves et al., 2019) provides an implementation of CLDs creating a display where any two means associated with same symbol are not statistically different.\nThe cld() function from the multcomp package is used to implement CLDs in the form of symbols or letters. The emmeans package provides a emmGrid objects for cld() method.\nLet’s start evaluating CLDs for main effects. We will use emmean objects m1 (for variety) and m2 (for nitrogen) for this.

Grain yield for Golden.rain variety was significantly lower with 0.0cwt N treatment compared to the 0.2cwt, 0.4cwt, and 0.6wt treatments.\nIn the data set we used for demonstration here, we had equal number of observations in each group. However, this might not be a case every time as it is common to have missing values in the data set. In such cases, readers usually struggle to interpret significant differences among groups. For example, estimated means of two groups are substantially different but they are no statistically different. This normally happens when SE of one group is large due to its small sample size, so it’s hard for it to be statistically different from other groups. In such cases, we can use alternatives to CLDs as shown below.",

Instead of looking at a variable as a collection of specific levels to estimate, random effects view variables as being a random draw from a probability distribution.\nThe decision of how to designate a variable as random or fixed depends on (1) your experimental aims with regard to inference and (2) your data structure. There is a philosophical consider and practical consideration. The philosophical approach is that random variable represents a small sample of a population you want to make inference on. The practical consideration is that when there are few sample levels, the random estimation procedure is not very reliable for those conditions. Ben Bolker has an excellent summary that we strongly recommend that you read to learn more about this. Below is an excerpt from that on the consequences of too few levels to estimate a random effect:\nThis animation show how accounting for grouping structure as random effects can impact the results of a linear model.",

A common example is a multi-environmental trial where multiple crop genotypes are evaluated at multiple locations and years. We can consider genotypes, locations and years as random effects depending on our experimental aims. Very few R packges can handle crossed random effects, but lme4 can!\nThe data used in this example is a collection of potato field trials conducted across 3 locations and 17 years. Each year, the same potato clones[^vc-1] are evaluated across all 3 locations, but each year, different clones are evaluated. Some clones are evaluted for multiple years, and a small number are evaluted each year. These potato clones were evaluated for the length-to-width ratio (LxW). We want to know how much location, year and clone contribute to this trait.\n[^vc-1] A clone is a genetically distinct potato genotype that is vegetatively propagated.

The remaining effects are random because (1) they represent a sample of the full population that inference is desired for, and (2) each has a sufficient number of levels to make estimation feasible.\n\npotato_m1 &lt;- lmer(LxW ~ state + (1|year) + (1|state:year) + (1|clone),\n                  data = potato)\n\n\nperformance::check_model(potato_m1, check = c('qq', 'linearity'), detrend=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.2.2 Inference on random effects\nThe variance components for each random effect can be extracted most easily using the tidy() function from broom.mixed.

There are several ways to test if random effects are impactful on the model overall. One of the most reliable and popular methods is the log likelihood ratio test. In brief, a reduced model is refit from a full specified model omitting a random variable. The log likelihood from the two models (the full specified and reduced models) are compared and a p-value is computed for that difference given the change in number of parameters estimated. The null hypothesis is that the models are equivalent and the alternative hypothesis is that the models are not equivalent. Hence, low p-values provide evidence that the omitted factor is impactful on the dependent variable of interest. :::\nThe function ranova() in lmerTest conducts log-likelihood ratio tests for all random effects in a model.[^vc-2]\n\nranova(potato_m1)\n\nANOVA-like table for random-effects: Single term deletions\n\nModel:\nLxW ~ state + (1 | year) + (1 | state:year) + (1 | clone)\n                 npar logLik     AIC    LRT Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)    \n&lt;none&gt;              7 494.47 -974.95                         \n(1 | year)          6 491.97 -971.94   5.01  1    0.02521 *  \n(1 | state:year)    6 407.42 -802.83 174.11  1    &lt; 2e-16 ***\n(1 | clone)         6  24.40  -36.80 940.15  1    &lt; 2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n[^vc-2] It is also possible to conduct likelihood tests manually by constructing reduced models and comparing it to the fully specificed (or more specified) model. In such cases, the fixed effects need to be identical between models, and they need to fit using maximimun likelihood instead of REML.\nIt is possible to make inferences on specific levels of random effects. This take a different analytical approach than fixed effects and has a different term, predictions, or more specifically Best Linear Unbiased Predictions, commonly called “BLUPs” (rhymes with “cups”). The estimated marginal means from fixed effects are technically BLUEs, or Best Linear Unbiased Estimates. By their nature, BLUPs “shrink” the estimates towards zero, reducing their overall spread compared to fixed effects. VSNi has a short summary on BLUPs and BLUEs.\nRecall that random effects are distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation, \\(\\sigma_b\\) that is estimated in the model fitting procedure. We can add the overall model intercept to all BLUPs in order to shift them to a scale that may be more intuitive for some. Since this constant (the model intercept) was added to all BLUPs, the overall relationship between the them (in this example, potato clones) is unchanged.\n\n# the model intercept\nintercept = fixef(potato_m1)[1]\n\n# all random effects from the model\nrandom_effects &lt;- REextract(potato_m1)\n\n# filter to clone BLUPs and add the intercept\nclone_re &lt;- filter(random_effects, groupFctr == \"clone\") |&gt; \n  rename(clone = groupID, BLUP = \"(Intercept)\", SE = \"(Intercept)_se\") |&gt; \n  mutate(blup_adj = BLUP + intercept)\n\n\nhist(clone_re$BLUP, ylab=NULL, xlab = NULL, main = \"Clone Random Effects\", col = \"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of Clone BLUPs\n\n\n\nBelow are the BLUPs (in red) and standard errors for each clone, arranged from lowest to highest length-to-width ratio.

    "text": "14.3 Nested variance components\nIt is possible to have a nested data set: learners in a classroom and classrooms in institutions, cows in dairies and dairies in counties or other regional indicators. These end up being truly hierarchical models, where we expect that there is some covariance between observations at the different levels. Cows in the same dairy are likely to be more correlated with each other than cows from another dairy. But how correlated? And how much does each grouping level influence the variation of whatever dependent variable is being studied.\nThis example is looking at pay at institutions of higher education in Washington. All annual earnings less than $25,000 were excluded from the data set, and only earners with a minimum of four years of data were included. Although this is public information, all individual names were anonymized.[^vc-3]\n[^vc-3] This data set (source) was incompletely curated and hence no substantive conclusions should be drawn from this particular analysis. This example is for teaching and demonstration purposes only.\nFor this data set, we are concerned with what is contributing to employee salaries over time - to what extent did year, the institution itself and the individual employee contribute to salary changes over time. While this reflects a complete data set for Washington State (all institutions, all employees), the interest is inference for other U.S. higher education institutions. This is an example where we will use random slopes to examine how an individual’s salary changed over time. The data set:\n|——-|——————————-| | agency | educational institution, 36 levels | | id | anonymized employee within each agency | | salary | annual salary | | year | year of salary, set to 0 for 2019 |\nThis is a rather large data set, and it requires quite a bit of computing power to analyze. Hence, the analysis was done locally, and the data set and model object were saved as a .RData file. Now let’s load this object into an R session.\n\nload(here::here(\"data/salary_models.RData\"))\n\n\n14.3.1 Model fitting\nSalary is very skewed, where the 70% of salaries are less than $100,000, but there are a few very high salaries, up to a maximum value of $3.1 million. We will log transform the data in a log-linear model for analysis. This is a special case of generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and the only GLMM model used because it still follow the assumption of normally-distributed residuals terms when a the dependent variable is log-transformed.\n\nhist(log(wa_salary$salary), ylab=NULL, xlab = NULL, main = \"Washington Higher Ed Salaries\", col = \"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of Log of Salaries\n\n\n\n\nboxplot(log(salary) ~ year, data = wa_salary, ylab=NULL, xlab = NULL, main = \"Salaries by Year\", col = \"turquoise\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxpplot of Log Salaries by Year\n\n\n\nThe analysis is derived from this model:\n\nm1 &lt;- lmer(log(salary) ~ factor(year0) + (year0|agency/id), \n           data = wa_salary, REML = FALSE)\n\nRandom intercepts and slopes were fit for agency and id nested within agency.\n\n\n14.3.2 Inference\n\nvar_comps_salary &lt;- tidy(m1, \"ran_pars\", scales = \"vcov\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(group, variance = \"estimate\") |&gt; \n  mutate(`percent variance` = round(variance/sum(variance) * 100, 1))\n\nvar_comps_salary\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  group     variance `percent variance`\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 id:agency  0.190                 81.2\n2 agency     0.00477                2  \n3 Residual   0.0391                16.7\n\n\n\n# the model intercept\nintercept = fixef(m1)[1]\n\n# all random effects from the model\nrandom_effects &lt;- REextract(m1)\n\n# filter to clone BLUPs and add the intercept\nclone_re &lt;- filter(random_effects, groupFctr == \"id:agency\") |&gt; \n  rename(employee = groupID, BLUP = \"(Intercept)\", SE = \"(Intercept)_se\") |&gt; \n  mutate(blup_adj = BLUP + intercept)",

    "text": "14.4 Variance estimation under heteroscedasticity\n\nIn the “general” linear model days, when a premium was placed on the i.i.d. error paradigm, if we did reject \\(H_0\\), it would set off a minor crisis in the form of a hunt for a variance stabilizing transformation. In contemporary modeling, we simply proceed with inference on estimable functions using the equal variance model.\n– Walt Stroup, Marina Ptukhiuna and Julie Garai (2024), Generalized Linear Mixed Models, \\(2^{nd}\\) Ed, Section 7.2.3.1\n\nIn previous sections, we have assumed the error terms or residuals were “i.i.d.”, that is “independently and identically distributed. This means they were shared the same distribution (identical) and were uncorrelated (independent). Longitudinal studies, that is, those with repeated measures, do have correlated residuals, so we relax the independence assumption and model those correlations. However, residuals can be unexpectedly related to the their observations, particular treatments or the order data was gathered from the experimental units (among other causes). As mentioned in the previous quote, we now have tools for handling this rather than trying to transform the data. Below are examples on how to model heteroscedasticity.\n\n14.4.1 Case 1: unequal variance due to a factor\nThis data set is from a set of canola variety trials conducted in a single year across multiple locations. The trials included 38 varieties that were evaluated at 9 locations using a RCBD design.\n\nvar_ex1 &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"MET_trial_variance.csv\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(block = as.character(block)) |&gt; \n  tidyr::drop_na()\n\nExploratory data visualizations indicate that the dependent variable, seed yield, varied greatly overall and certain locations had smaller variance compared to others.\n\nhist(var_ex1$yield)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboxplot(yield ~ site, data = var_ex1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study is not fully crossed; all sites did not include all varieties, although there is substantial overlap. As a result, only variety and the site-by-variety interaction are included in the statistical model.\n\nm1_a &lt;- lme(yield ~ site:variety + variety, \n                random = ~ 1 |site/block, \n                na.action = na.exclude, \n                data = var_ex1)\n\nThe residual plot indicates some association between the residuals and fitted values.\n\nplot(m1_a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add a term to model the variance by site.\n\\[Var(\\epsilon_{ij}) = \\sigma^2 \\delta^2_{s_{ij}} \\] Details on the implementation can be found in (Pinheiro and Bates 2000).\n\nm1_b &lt;- update(m1_a, weights = varIdent(form = ~1|site))\n\nThe function varIdent() is used to set the stratifying variable at which to estimate variance. Like many functions in R, there are additional arguments to consider for more complex scenarios (type ?varIdent in an R console to check).\n\n\nm1_b &lt;- update(m1_a, weights = varIdent(form = ~1|site))\n\nis equivalent to\n\nm1_b &lt;- lme(yield ~ site:variety + variety, \n                random = ~ 1 |site/block,\n                weights = varIdent(form = ~1|site), \n                na.action = na.exclude, \n                data = var_ex1)\n\n\nThe residual plot is now much cleaner. The result is a better-fitting model and with that, better inference for variety at the site level.\n\nplot(m1_b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanova(m1_a, m1_b)\n\n     Model  df      AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\nm1_a     1 345 14826.99 16524.62 -7068.493                        \nm1_b     2 353 14499.68 16236.68 -6896.840 1 vs 2 343.3059  &lt;.0001\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2 Case 2: Variance is related to the fitted values\nThis is the infamous ‘horn’ pattern in the residuals-vs-fitted values plot. This is another canola trial using 38 varieties conducted at a single year and single location.\n\nvar_ex2 &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"single_trial_variance.csv\")) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(block = as.character(block))\n\nA histogram does indicate there is anything unusual about the dependent variabe (seed yield), except that is varies quite a bit, ranging from 24 to nearly 950 units.\n\nhist(var_ex2$yield)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this experiment has a single fixed effect and is arranged using a RCBD, the model is same as described in the RCBD chapter.\n\nm2_a &lt;- lme(yield ~ variety, \n               random = ~ 1 |block, \n               na.action = na.exclude, \n               data = var_ex2)\n\nAn inspection of the residual plot indicates a clear mean-variance relationship.\n\nplot(m2_a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mean-variance relationship can be mitigated by modelling the variance directly as a function of any covariate in the model using a power function.\n\\[ Var(\\epsilon_{ij}) = \\sigma^2|\\nu_{ij}|^{2\\delta}\\]\nWe can accomplish this using the nlme function varPower(). This function can take other covariates, but when there is no argument provided, it defaults to using the fitted values.\n\nm2_b &lt;- update(m2_a, weights = varPower())\n\nThe model fit is substantially improved according to visual inspection of the residuals and the results of a likelihood ratio test.\n\nplot(m2_b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanova(m2_a, m2_b)\n\n     Model df      AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\nm2_a     1 40 1545.596 1655.044 -732.7978                        \nm2_b     2 41 1519.199 1631.383 -718.5996 1 vs 2 28.39636  &lt;.0001\n\n\nThere are many other ways of using these functions for modeling heteroscedasticity.

    "text": "15.1 Common errors we encounter\nIn this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to use linear mixed models for different experiment designs using examples we have already tested and know work. However, it is likely that you will eventually have issues in fitting mixed models in R. This section discusses common issues and errors that might come up when implementing mixed models.\nThis can happen when trying to fit a model that is too complex for the amount of data available, or when the random effects are very small and cannot be distinguished from zero.\nThis error occurs because one of the variance component is approximately zero. If a model is “singular”, this means that some dimensions of the variance-covariance matrix have been estimated as nearly zero or as close to zero as your computer’s precision will allow.\nThere is no single solution for this problem. Here are the possible solutions that you can try:\nFirst, look at the summary of the fitted model using summary() function, If random effect variance is near zero, simplify the model by removing it. However, by removing the random effect we are loosing the model complexity and potentially important variation that the random effect was initially intended to capture.\nOr other option is to include the block as a fixed effects and re-analyze the experiment. If there are no other random effects in the model, you can use the function gls() in nlme that uses generalized least squares for model fit and allows for correlated and unequal variances.\nfixed-effect model matrix is rank deficient\nHarpreet: Do we need to discuss this?\nconvergence error code = 1 message = iteration limit reached without convergence (10)\nHessian that is not positive definite\nThere are several causes for lack of convergence. Model fitting is an iterative process where in each iteration, the latest estimates are compared to the estimates from the previous iteration. When there difference becomes sufficiently small, modelling packages declare that convergence criteria were met. There are several reasons why a model may not converge: (1) it needed more iterations, (2) the model does not fit the data well, (3) the software did not have a decent starting point for this model and data; among other plausible explanations.\nRunning this code in an R console will bring up a useful help file with details on how to address convergence issues.\n?convergence\nPossible solutions to fix this error are: - Try a different optimizer\nmodel &lt;- lmer(y ~ x + (1|block), data = dataset)\nmodel1 &lt;- update(model, control = lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\ndefault optimizer used in lmer() is “Nelder_Mead”, “bobyqa” optimizer is recommended for stability.\nWe can update our existing model by increasing max iterations to 100,000.\nmodel &lt;- lmer(y ~ x + (1|block), data = dataset)\nmodel2 &lt;- update(model1, control = lmerControl(optCtrl = list(maxfun = 100000)))\nTroubleshooting LMM model failures is difficult. One thing that helps is to browse through your data and make sure it looks like what you expect, and that your expectations of the variables are how R seem them as well.\nHaving an understanding of the moving parts of lme4 and how they each contribute to model fit can help. A help ful lme4 control structures for model fitting can be accessed via ?lmerControl.\nPosit (née RStudio) has published a rather useful guide for advanced troubleshooting of convergence issues in lme4. Phillip Alday wrote a detailed tutorial on lme4 convergence warnings.",
