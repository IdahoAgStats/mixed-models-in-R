*"Path in the Wilderness" by Erich Taeubel, Jr.*

Running mixed models in R is no easy task. There are dozens of packages supporting these aims, each with varying functionality, syntax, and conventions. The linear mixed model ecosystem in R consists of over 80 libraries that either construct and solve mixed model equations or helper packages the process the results from mixed model analysis. These libraries provide a patchwork of overlapping and unique functionality regarding the fundamental structure of mixed models: allowable distributions, nested and crossed random effects, heterogeneous error structures and other facets. No single library has all possible functionality enabled.

This patchwork of packages makes it very challenging for statisticians to conduct mixed model analysis and to teach others how to run mixed models in R. We have written this guide to provide recipes for handling common analytical scenarios encountered in agricultural sciences that require mixed models. As a field guide, it is intended to be succinct, and to help researchers meet their analytic goals.

## What This Does Not Cover

* Generalized linear models where the response variable does not follow a normal distribution. We do address cases of unequal variance, but if another distribution and/or a link function is required for the model, that is not addressed in this guide. 

* Basic principles of experimental design. We assume you know this, but if you do not, please check out the [Grammar of Experimental Design](https://emitanaka.org/edibble-book/){.external target="_blank"} for guidance on these topics. 

* Instructions in using R. We assume familiarity with R. If you need help in learning R, there are numerous guides, including our [introductory R course](https://idahoagstats.github.io/r-for-ag-scientists/){.external target="_blank"}.
