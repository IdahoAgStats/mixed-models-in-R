# Introduction

This guide is focused on frequentist implementations of mixed models in R. If someone wants to write a Bayesian guide, please go for it! I'm not experience sufficiently in Bayesian to do this.

Each section contains the minimum to run a model, with more detail found at the later chapters. Unless I decide it makes more sense to include early materials.

A Tidymodels framework is used whenever possible because that is a promising avenue for making the syntax easier to write across packages.
