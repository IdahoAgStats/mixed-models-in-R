# Split Plot Design

Split-plot design is frequently used for factorial experiments. Such design may incorporate one or more of the completely randomized (CRD), completely randomized block (RCBD), and Latin square designs. The main principle is that there are whole plots or whole units, to which the levels of one or more factors are applied. Thus each whole plot becomes a block for the subplot treatments.

## Details for Split Plot Designs

1.  Whole Plot Randomized as a completely randomized design

The statistical model structure this design:

$$y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_k + (\alpha_j\beta_k) + \epsilon_{ij} + \delta_{ijk} $$ Where:

$\mu$= overall experimental mean, $\alpha$ = main effect of whole plot (fixed), $\beta$ = main effect of subplot (fixed), $\alpha$$\tau$ = interaction between factors A and B, $\epsilon_{ij}$ = whole plot error, $\delta_{ijk}$ = subplot error.

$$ \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon)$$

$$\ \delta  \sim N(0, \sigma_\delta)$$

Both the error and the rep effects are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations of $\sigma_\epsilon$ and $\sigma_\delta$, respectively.

2.  Whole Plot Randomized as an RCBD

The statistical model structure for split plot design:

$$y_{ijk} = \mu + \rho_j +  \alpha_i + \beta_k + (\alpha_i\beta_k) + \epsilon_{ij} + \delta_{ijk}$$ Where:

$\mu$ = overall experimental mean, $\rho$ = block effect (random), $\alpha$ = main effect of whole plot (fixed), $\beta$ = main effect of subplot (fixed), $\alpha$$\beta$ = interaction between factors A and B, $\epsilon_{ij}$ = whole plot error, $\delta_{ijk}$ = subplot error.

$$ \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon)$$

$$\ \delta  \sim N(0, \sigma_\delta)$$

Both the overall error and the rep effects are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations of $\sigma$ and $sigma_B$, respectively.

## Analysis Examples

### Example model for CRD Split Plot Designs

height_data used for this example has a split plot design as follows: 3 replicates, in each rep there are four plots (whole-plot) representing time; Besides, the whole-plot is divided into 8 sub-plots to apply different management (manage) levels.

1.  Load required libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
library(emmeans)
library(lme4)
library(multcompView)
install.packages("performance")
library(performance)
```

2.  Import height data and check the structure of the data.

```{r}
library(readxl)
height_data <- read_excel(here::here("data", "height_data.xlsx"))

table(height_data$time, height_data$manage)

str(height_data)

```

3.  Explore data

```{r}
ggplot(data = height_data, aes(y = height, x = time)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour = manage))
```

```{r}
library(agridat)
data(gomez.splitplot.subsample.txt)
```

4.  Specify a model for data

The statistical model structure for split plot design:

$$y_{ijk} = \mu + \rho_i +  \alpha_j + \beta_k + (\alpha_j\beta_k) + \epsilon_{ijk}$$ 

Where:

$\mu$ = overall experimental mean, $\rho$ = block/rep effect (random), $\alpha$ = main effect of whole plot (fixed), $\beta$ = main effect of subplot (fixed), $\alpha$$\beta$ = interaction between factors A and B, $\epsilon$ = error.

$$ \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$$

$$ \rho \sim N(0, \sigma_b)$$

Both the overall error and the rep effects are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations of $\sigma$ and $sigma_B$, respectively.

#### 'iid' assumption for error terms

In this model, the error terms, $\epsilon$ are assumed to be "iid", that is, independently and identically distributed. This means they have constant variance and they each individual error term is independent from the others.

```{r}
model1<-lmer(height ~ time*manage + (1|rep/time), data=height_data)

summary(model1)

```

```{r}
plot(model1)

qqnorm(resid(model1)); qqline(resid(model1))



# checking model assumptions
check_model(model1)

```

5.  Interpretation of the model:

```{r}
anova(model1)
```

```{r}
library(multcomp)
emmeans(model1, ~ time*manage)
```

### Example model for RCBD Split Plot Designs

Design Summary:

Main plot = Variety (V), 3 levels

Subplot = Nitrogen (N), 4 levels

Number of blocks (B) = 6

Dependent variable = yield (Y)

To fully examine the yield of oats due to varieties and nutrient levels in a split plots. We will need to statistically analyse and compare the effects of varieties, nutrient levels, their interaction, and the effects of plots and subplots.

**Load the data:**

```{r}
library(MASS)
data("oats")
head(oats,10)
```

Evaluate the structure of the data. The "B", "V", and "N" needs to be 'factor' and "Y" should be numeric.

```{r}
str(oats)
```

```{r}
table(oats$V, oats$N)
```

**Building the Model**

```{r}
model2 <- lmer(Y ~ V + N + V:N + (1|B) + (1|B:V), data = oats)
summary(model2)
```

**Assumption tests**

Normality of residuals and homogenous variance

```{r}
# checking model assumptions
check_model(model2)
```

**Analysis of Variance** (ANOVA)

```{r}
anova(model2)
```

Post-Hoc analysis

```{r}
emm <- emmeans(model2, ~ variety * nutrient) comparison <- cld(emm, Letters = LETTERS, reversed = T) comparison
```

### Split-split plot design in R

In this example, we have a yield data of 3 different rice varieties grown under 3 management practices and 5 Nitrogen levels. In this spliy-split design:

blocks = block (3 blocks),

Whole plot factor = Nitrogen (5 levels)

Sub plot = management (3 levels)

sub-subplot = variety (3 levels)

Statistical model:

Here, we are extracting the rice yield data from `agricolae` package.

```{r}
library(agricolae)
f <- system.file("external/ssp.csv", package="agricolae")
rice <-read.csv(f)
```

Exploratory analysis

```{r}
str(rice)
```

Convert block, nitrogen, variety, and management to factors.

```{r}
rice$block<-factor(rice$block)
rice$nitrogen<-factor(rice$nitrogen)
rice$management<-factor(rice$management)
rice$variety<-factor(rice$variety)
```

Statistical model

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(emmeans)
library(lme4)
library(multcompView)
install.packages("performance")
library(performance)
```

Here is the basic split-split plot analysis. We can use the nesting notation in the random part because nitrogen and management are nested in blocks. We can do blocks as fixed or random.

```{r}
model3 <-lmer(yield ~  block + nitrogen*management*variety + (1|block/nitrogen/management),data=rice, na.action = na.exclude)

summary(model3)

```

Model Diagnostics: we observed a constant variance and normality of residuals.

```{r}

plot(model3)
qqnorm(residuals(model3)); qqline(residuals(model3))

library(see)
check_model(model3)
```

Analysis of variance

```{r}
anova(model3)
Anova(model3,test="F")
```

Post-Hoc analysis

```{r}
emmeans(model3, ~ nitrogen)
emmeans(model3, ~ variety*management)
```

```{r}
emm <- emmeans(model3, ~ nitrogen*variety) 
comparison <- cld(emm, Letters = LETTERS, reversed = T) 
comparison
```
