# Mixed model theory and background

Mixed-effects models are called ‚Äúmixed‚Äù because they simultaneously model fixed and random effects. Fixed effects (e.g. treatments) represent population-level (i.e., average) effects that should persist across experiments. Fixed effects are similar to the parameters found in ‚Äútraditional‚Äù regression techniques like ordinary least squares. Random effects are discrete units sampled from some population (e.g. plots, pariticipants), they are inherently categorical (Winter, 2019).

Recall simple linear regression with intercept (Œ≤~0~) and slope (Œ≤~1~) effect for subject *i*. The (Œ≤~0~) and (Œ≤~1~) are chosen in a way so that the residual sum of squares is as small as possible.

$$  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X) + ùú∫$$

If we consider this model in a mixed model framework, Œ≤~0~ and Œ≤~1~ are considered fixed effects (also known as the population-averaged values) and b*i* is a random effect for subject *i*. The random effect can be thought of as each subject‚Äôs deviation from the fixed intercept parameter. The key assumption about *bi* is that it is **independent, identically and normally distributed with a mean of zero and associated variance**. Random effects are especially useful when we have (1) lots of levels (e.g., many species or blocks), (2) relatively little data on each level (although we need multiple samples from most of the levels), and (3) uneven sampling across levels.

For example, if we let the intercept be a random effect, it takes the form:

$$  Y = \beta_0 + b_i + \beta_1(X) + ùú∫$$

In this model, predictions would vary depending on each subject‚Äôs random intercept term, but slopes would be the same:

In second case, we can have a fixed intercept and a random slope. The model will be:

$$  Y = \beta_0 + (\beta_1 + b_i)(X) + ùú∫$$

In this model, the *bi* is a random effect for subject *i* applied to the slope. Predictions would vary with random slope term, but the intercept will be the same:
