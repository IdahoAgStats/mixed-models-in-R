* [lme4 vignette for fitting linear mixed models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf){.external target="_blank"} 

* [*Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b98882){.external target="_blank"} *thee book* for **nlme**, by Jos√© C. Pinheiro and Douglas M. Bates (2000). We used this book extensively for developing this guide. Sadly, it's both out of print and we could not find a free copy online. However, there are affordable used copies available. 

* [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/data-analysis-using-regression-and-multilevel-hierarchical-models/32A29531C7FD730C3A68951A17C9D983#overview){.external target="_blank"} by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill (2006). Good general introduction with a major focus on Bayesian models. [Free PDF](https://github.com/tmastny/Data-Analysis-Using-Regression-and-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models)
