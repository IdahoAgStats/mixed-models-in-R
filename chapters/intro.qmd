# Introduction

This guide is focused on frequent implementations of mixed models in R, covering different scenarios common in the agricultural sciences.

This is not intended to be a guide to the theory of mixed models, it is focused on implementations of models only.

A Tidymodels framework is shown whenever possible because that is a promising avenue for making the syntax easier to write across packages.

## Terms

Please read this section and refer back to if when you forget what these terms mean.

| Term              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Random effect     | An independent variable where the levels being estimated compose a random sample from a population whose variance will be estimated                                                                                                                                           |
| Fixed effect      | An independent variable with specific, predefined levels to estimate                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Experimental unit | The smallest unit being used for analysis. This could be an animal, a field plot, a person, a meat or muscle sample. The unit may be assessed multitple times or through multiple point in time. When the analysis is all said and done, the predictions occur at this level. |

This entire guide will use the [**here**](https://here.r-lib.org/) package for loading data. If you can load your data fine without ths package, please carry on. {here} is certainly not required for running mixed models.
